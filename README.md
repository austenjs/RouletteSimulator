# Roulette Simulator

Do you want to test your luck in Roulette the next time you go to a casino? Not sure how much should you bet? Fret not because you can simulate your games (and potential wins) using a Roulette Simulator!


# Quick Start

There are two main files you can try on. One file uses the American Roulette table while the other one uses the European Roulette table.

To simulate Roulette on American table, run:
```
 python simulate_america_table.py
 ```
To simulate Roulette on European table, run:
```
 python simulate_european_table.py
 ```

# Advance Usage
If you want to implement your strategy in this simulator, you can extend the base *Player* class located in `RouletteSimulator/player/player.py` and modify the main file(s).
